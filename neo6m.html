        <h2>NEO-6M</h2>
        <div class="desc2">The heart of the module is a NEO-6M GPS chip from u-blox. 
            It can track up to 22 satellites on 50 channels and achieves the industry’s highest 
            level of sensitivity i.e. -161 dB tracking, while consuming only 45mA supply current. 
            The u-blox 6 positioning engine also boasts a Time-To-First-Fix (TTFF) of 
            under 1 second. One of the best features the chip provides is Power Save Mode(PSM). 
            It allows a reduction in system power consumption by selectively switching parts 
            of the receiver ON and OFF. This dramatically reduces power consumption of the 
            module to just 11mA making it suitable for power sensitive applications like GPS 
            wristwatch. The necessary data pins of NEO-6M GPS chip are broken out to a "0.1″ 
            pitch headers. This includes pins required for communication with a microcontroller
             over UART.

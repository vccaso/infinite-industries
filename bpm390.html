            The BMP3xx is the next-generation of sensors from Bosch, and is the upgrade to 
            the BMP280 - with a low altitude noise as low as 0.1m and the same fast conversion 
            time. And like the previous BMP280, you can use I2C or SPI. For simple easy wiring, 
            go with I2C. If you want to connect a bunch of sensors without worrying about 
            I2C address collisions, go with SPI.

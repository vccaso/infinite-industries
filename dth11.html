        <div class="desc2">The DHT11 detects water vapor by measuring the electrical resistance between two electrodes. 
            The humidity sensing component is a moisture holding substrate with electrodes applied to the surface. 
            When water vapor is absorbed by the substrate, ions are released by the substrate which increases the conductivity between the electrodes. 
            The change in resistance between the two electrodes is proportional to the relative humidity. 
            Higher relative humidity decreases the resistance between the electrodes, while lower relative humidity increases the resistance between the electrodes.
            The DHT11 measures temperature with a surface mounted NTC temperature sensor (thermistor) built into the unit. 
            To learn more about how thermistors work and how to use them on the Arduino, check out this Arduino Thermistor Temperature Sensor Tutorial.
